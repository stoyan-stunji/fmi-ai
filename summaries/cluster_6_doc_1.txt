	New since version of 18 April 1993: New version of XV supports bit viewing for 
X Windows. 
	New versions of DVPEG Image Alchemy for DOS. 
	New versions of Image Archiver PMView for New listing: MGIF for monochrome-display Ataris. 
	Why use JPEG? 
	How well does JPEG compress images? 
	What are good "quality" settings for JPEG? 
	"canned" software, viewers, etc source code What's all this hoopla about color quantization? 
	Why all the argument about file formats? 
	If you don't get a reply, the server may be misreading your return address; add 
a line such as "path myname@mysite" to specify your correct e-mail address to reply to. 
	JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical 
to what you originally put in The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting 
known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived 
as well as small details of light-and-dark. 
	You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful 
for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc etc Conversely, if you aren't 
happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the 
quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression. 
	Why use JPEG? 
	How well does JPEG compress images? 
	The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free 
JPEG software described in section 6B. 
	What are good "quality" settings for JPEG? 
	Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. 
	The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write s proprietary 
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.
