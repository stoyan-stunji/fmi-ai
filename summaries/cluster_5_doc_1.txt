With renewed interest in "setting the DISPLAY variable", etc. 
	This Perl script is my solution. 
	It trys to be intelligent about what it's doing so that you should be able 
to type "rx host.domainetc", and get a xterm running on "host.domainetc", with all the difficult 
stuff taken care of. 
	In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do when you wanted 
to run a remote command in the background it doesn't even need to be an 
X program. 
	Try a "rx big-machine make" for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote "big-machine". 
	For more details and a full list of features read the README file, about 20 
lines below... 
	To overwrite existing files, type "sh file -c". 
	If this archive is complete, you will see the following message at the end: "End

	Including X setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names, and passing X magic cookies, or
