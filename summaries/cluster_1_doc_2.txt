My turn to jump in! 
	I think you mean circular, not recursive, but that is semantics. 
	Recursiveness has no problems, it is just horribly inefficient (just ask any assembly programmer.) The 
oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that 
line were in the process of proving. 
	Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the 
cost to another. 
	Whos liberty is more inalienable? 
	Similarly for right of life. 
	That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for 
serial killers. 
	According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone 
should be able to remove them. 
	It means that killing an infant is not murder because it cannot be against its 
will. 
	How will you include that? 
	The only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the 
rules. 
	Might Makes Right. 
	If you mean the golden rule as I stated, yes, almost every system as implemented 
has used that in reality. 
	If you can find some part of society, some societal rules, morals, etc that are 
not arbitrary, please tell me. 
	The difference seems to be, that objective is some reasoning that I like, while arbitrary 
is some reasoning that I don't like OR don't understand.
