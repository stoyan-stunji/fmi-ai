The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the incredible level of utter 
bullshit, has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of "The 
Best of Alt.Atheism" for your reading pleasure. 
	ll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that I stop, 
or I run out of good material. 
	Johnson, but someone correct me if m wrong. 
	This is probably the longest of my entire collection. 
	________________________________________________________ So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled * In considering the Christian religion, and judging 
it according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling 
earlier Jewish prophecy. 
	The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are 
prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth. 
	As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often 
not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New 
Testament. 
	We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts. 
	Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do 
not know how much happened exactly as stated. 
	But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value. 
	Immanuel: We begin, of course, at the beginning. 
	for he will save his people from their sins." All this happened to fulfil what 
the lord had spoken by a prophet: In the days of Ahaz king of Judah, 
Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but 
could not quite conquer it. 
	And, the lord d said to Isaiah, "go to meet with Ahaz..." ...And the lord 
spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah, naturally) saying, "Ask a sign of d your lord. 
	It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven." But, Ahaz said, 
"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a test." Then (Isaiah) said, 
"Hear then, O house of David. 
	Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it 
fit the specific case of Mary. 
	Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child. 
	Of course, the fit is shady and has problems. 
	Egypt: After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion 
to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses. 
	For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three 
nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three 
days and three nights. 
	There is no "perfect praise" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there 
is given to d, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.
