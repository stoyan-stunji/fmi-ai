	On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON rockets lifted 
off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan Republic. 
	Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe for the planet Venus. 
	Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical 
craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit. 
	The dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information 
to Earth. 
	The radar system, possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by the Soviets 
for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus' surface at a resolution of 
one to two kilometers to miles). 
	The twin probes thus became Venus' first polar-circling spacecraft Radar operations began on October 16 
for VENERA 15 and October 20 for VENERA 16. 
	In contrast, the polar air above sixty kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty 
degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights. 
	Venus by Balloon For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting target 
to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of air with balloon-borne instruments. 
	The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named VEGA 1 and 2, a 
contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI Gallei being the Russian word for Halley.
