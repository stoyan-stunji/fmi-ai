	US PLANETARY MISSIONS MARINER (VENUS, MARS, MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS) MARINER 1, the first attempt 
to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed minutes after launch in 1962. 
	The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with 
its antenna, so the onboard computer took control. 
	Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both 
the geological and biological sense. 
	It reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus 
the information that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that 
of Earth's, or the equivalent of being feet under the surface of an ocean. 
	MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to orbit Mars 
in 1971. 
	PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS) PIONEER 1 through 3 failed 
to meet their main objective to photograph the Moon close-up but they did reach far 
enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, 
including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. 
	PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and 
it instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to million kilometers in 
1960, a record until MARINER 2. 
	PIONEER E sent four small probes into the atmosphere in December of 1978. 
	RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS) RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the 
RANGER lunar impact series. 
	SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS) The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO 
lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the soil 
(before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered in great 
layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing vehicle). 
	The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19, 1976, and the lander set down 
on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976. 
	LUNA 2 First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959. 
	SOVIET VENUS PROBES VENERA 1 First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission.
