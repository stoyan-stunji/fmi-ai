Thanks to all who responded to my original post. 
	I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to 
upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS. 
	It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/ write heads and up to 
1024 cylinders. 
	The upgrade is $15, payable by check or money order. 
	Send to: Western Digital Corporation Technical Support Group Box 19665 Irvine, CA The Super BIOS 
is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the WD1002 series. 
	The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives. 
	Make sure that the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy 
disk) the coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.
